"""Generate LICENSE-3rd-party.txt — the full third-party dependency closure.

Covers *everything* installed in the environment, transitive packages included, because that is
what a user actually ends up with on disk.

Two exclusions, both by definition rather than convenience:

  * NVIDIA first-party distributions (``nvidia-*``, ``cuda-*``, ``transformer-engine*``, apex,
    multi-storage-client). This is a *third-party* notice file; our own packages are not a third
    party. This mirrors what the predecessor repo did by hand in cosmos-anomalygen commit c3ed9ef
    ("Exclude NVIDIA packages from 3rd-party licenses").

    First-party authorship is not the same as first-party *content*: ``megatron-core`` and
    ``cosmos-framework`` are NVIDIA projects that incorporate third-party code, so the notice
    obligations for that code apply to the container regardless of who packaged it. Both are
    attributed here — see ``FIRST_PARTY_WITH_THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT``, which also records which
    first-party packages were audited and found to carry no such material.
  * This repo's own packages (paidf-anomalygen, the lerobot stub).

Pass ``--include-nvidia`` to emit the unfiltered closure instead.

Every license fact is read from the *installed* distribution — dist-info METADATA and the license
files the wheel ships. Nothing is asserted from memory. Where a wheel ships no license text, it is
fetched from the pinned upstream URL in ``UPSTREAM_LICENSE_URLS`` on every run — pinned to a tag or
commit, so the text is the one that shipped with the installed version rather than whatever the
default branch says today. A distribution with neither a bundled text nor a mapped URL is a hard
error rather than a silent omission. Network access is therefore required.

Run inside the environment whose contents you are attributing. For the committed
``LICENSE-3rd-party.txt`` that means the `develop` Docker image, not a local venv — a dev machine
accumulates packages the image never has.

`develop`, not `product`, is what this project releases, so its ``requirements-dev.txt`` tooling is
in scope deliberately. That file is pinned to keep this artefact reproducible:

    docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace/paidf-anomalygen" -w /workspace/paidf-anomalygen \
        "$IMAGE" /opt/venv/bin/python scripts/generate_third_party_licenses.py

Write the output into the bind-mounted repo; a container-local path is lost on exit. Re-run after
changing dependencies, then diff the result before committing it.

# Copyleft policy. Two gates, because copyleft reaches the image by two routes.
#
# 1. The package's own metadata label — what a distribution DECLARES about itself.
# 2. The `License:` declaration lines inside the notice texts it ships — what it declares about
#    third-party code it vendors. A wheel that bundles someone else's binaries labels itself in
#    METADATA and describes the bundled ones in its notice, so gate 1 is blind to them by
#    construction. That blind spot is not hypothetical: vendored GPL-3.0 source reached this image
#    once already behind a non-copyleft package label, and only a human review caught it.

# each other — MPL-2.0's Exhibit wording and every LGPL text name the GNU GPL — so a full-text scan
# would fire on packages we already ship, and a gate that cries wolf is a gate someone switches off.
#
# SCOPE, stated plainly because the narrow form fails silently and that is the worse direction for
# a gate: this catches STRUCTURED, Debian-style `License:` declarations on a single line. It does
# NOT catch, and these still need human eyes on a dependency bump:
#   * dual-licensing described in PROSE. pillow ships the same FreeType as matplotlib under the
#     same terms, in prose, with no `License:` line anywhere in its section — matplotlib trips the
#     gate and pillow does not. Neither is a compliance problem; the asymmetry is the point.
#   * a value on the FOLLOWING line (`License:\n  <text>`), which `(.+)` cannot see. Two such
#     stanzas already exist in the artefact; both are non-copyleft today.
# The blind spot is narrowed, not closed. Read this gate as "no structured copyleft declaration
