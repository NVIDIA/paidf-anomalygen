# train_control.sh — launch an AnomalyGen fine-tune that outlives the shell, and wait for it in slices.
#
# A fine-tune runs ~1 h at max_iter=5000 and ~4 h at the 15000 default: far longer than one foreground
# command, so it is launched detached with a PID file and a log, then polled.
#
#   scripts/skill_utility/train_control.sh start --name phone_screen --recipe ag_config/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml
#   scripts/skill_utility/train_control.sh wait  --name phone_screen        # repeat until it stops exiting 2
#   scripts/skill_utility/train_control.sh stop  --name phone_screen
#
# 'wait' blocks for --timeout seconds (default 570, just under a 10-minute tool budget) and reports the
# run's state as its EXIT CODE, so "still going" is never confused with "finished":
#
#   0  finished    the log holds 'Done with training'      -> go to Step 4
#   1  failed      the log holds a traceback, or the process died without the marker
#   2  running     the slice elapsed with the run healthy  -> call 'wait' again, as many times as it takes
#
# Exit 2 is the normal case for most of a run: at ~9.5 min a slice, the 15000 default takes ~25 of them.
# A checkpoint appearing is NOT the finish line — the trainer writes one every save_iter and all but the
# last are intermediate. Gate on exit 0.
#
# Options:
#   start  --name <n> --recipe <path> [--num_gpus 1] [--scripts <dir>] [--task texture_ft]
#          [-- <hydra overrides>]   appended after experiment=, e.g. for a two-minute smoke test:
#          -- trainer.max_iter=20 trainer.validation_iter=10 checkpoint.save_iter=10
#   wait   --name <n> [--timeout 570] [--interval 30]
#   stop   --name <n>
#
# Paths are relative to the repo root; run it from there. Logs and PID files land in ./results.
