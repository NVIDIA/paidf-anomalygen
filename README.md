# Physical AI Data Factory (PAIDF) AnomalyGen

PAIDF AnomalyGen is a diffusion-based pipeline for **Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)** of anomaly
images in a few-shot scenario. It adapts the base Cosmos generator into an **anomaly-generation**
model for *your* defect types: given a clean product image and a mask marking where a defect
should go, the fine-tuned model paints a realistic defect of the requested type into that region.
Because only a small parameter subset is trained on top of a frozen base network, a handful of real
examples per defect is enough to fine-tune, runs are cheap, and the resulting checkpoints are
tiny — a scalable source of synthetic anomaly data for training downstream defect detectors and
segmenters.

## Overview

**High-level flow:** the texture workflow runs end to end in seven stages, each feeding the next.

1. **Dataset preparation** — turn an upstream source into the `anomaly_image/` + `mask/` +
   `clean_image/` layout the trainer expects.
2. **Auto mask placement (AMP)** — decide where each defect goes and place its mask on the clean
   images, building the `testcase.jsonl` that fine-tuning and generation consume.
3. **Fine-tuning** — train the model on the `anomaly_image/` + `mask/` pairs.
4. **Generation (SDG)** — run the fine-tuned checkpoint over a batch of testcases to synthesize
   defect images.
5. **Evaluation** — score the batch against real references with the KPI. Optionally filter it into
   a clean `keep/` set.
6. **Quality refinement** — search per-sample generation parameters over repeated
   draw → generate → evaluate rounds, then keep the best variant of each sample.
7. **Pseudo-labeling** — turn the refined batch into a labeled dataset: a COCO instance dataset, a
   per-class classification layout, and optional captions.

Zooming into Generation (SDG) — the path a single image takes at generation time, once the
per-defect-type LoRA is trained:

Generation is conditioned on two things at once. The **text condition** turns a prompt into tokens
for the VLM. The **vision condition** takes a clean image plus a target mask, replaces the masked
region with noise, and encodes it into a source latent. The Diffusion model — frozen, with a small
per-defect-type LoRA on top — denoises the target latent from both, and the VAE decoder turns it
back into an image with the defect painted into the masked region.

## Installation

**Requirements:**

- NVIDIA driver supporting CUDA 13.2, and a **visible GPU at build time** — some of the compiled
  CUDA extensions autodetect the target arch, and silently build without GPU kernels if they cannot
  see one.
- A host C/C++ toolchain (`gcc`/`g++`) and `git` — several dependencies are compiled from source
  or installed straight from a git URL.

### Get the source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/paidf-anomalygen.git
cd paidf-anomalygen
```

### Virtual environment

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as the virtual environment manager.

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Build the venv:

```shell
# MAX_JOBS: parallel compile jobs (default 16)
# NVCC_THREADS: threads per nvcc invocation (default 1)
bash scripts/env_setup.sh [MAX_JOBS] [NVCC_THREADS]
```

Then authenticate to Hugging Face, fetch the model checkpoints, and confirm the environment is
sound. The checkpoints are gated, so **accept both the `nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano` and
`nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge` licenses on Hugging Face** with the same account before downloading:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
hf auth login                   # or: export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>
bash scripts/download_checkpoints.sh
scripts/preflight_env_ckpt.sh   # GPU, Python, CUDA/torch, deps, HF auth, checkpoints
```

### Docker

A prebuilt image is published publicly on
[NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/paidf-anomalygen) — no registry
login required:

```shell
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/paidf-anomalygen:1.1.0
```

The tag tracks this repo's `VERSION`. If it is not yet on the
[tag list](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/paidf-anomalygen/tags), that version
has not been released yet — **build the image from this checkout rather than pulling an older tag**.

Building — including the `develop` / `product` / air-gapped targets — is covered in
[docker/README.md](docker/README.md).

## Usage

### Tutorial

An end-to-end walkthrough of the pipeline above — from a clean environment to a filtered,
pseudo-labeled set of synthetic anomalies — lives under `docs/tutorial/texture/`. Start at
[1 · Overview & Environment Setup](docs/tutorial/texture/1-overview.md), which explains what you will
build and sets up the environment (venv or Docker, checkpoints, smoke test). The pages:

1. [Overview & Environment Setup](docs/tutorial/texture/1-overview.md) — install and smoke test.
2. [Dataset Preparation](docs/tutorial/texture/2-dataset-preparation.md) — build the dataset layout.
3. [Auto Mask Placement](docs/tutorial/texture/3-auto-mask-placement.md) — place defect masks to build the testcases.
4. [Fine-tuning](docs/tutorial/texture/4-fine-tuning.md) — train the per-defect-type LoRAs.
5. [Generation](docs/tutorial/texture/5-generation.md) — generate synthetic anomalies from the fine-tuned checkpoint.
6. [Evaluation, Refinement & Pseudo-labeling](docs/tutorial/texture/6-evaluation-and-refinement.md) — evaluate, filter, refine & pseudo-label.

### Agent skills

The pipeline ships as [agent skills](skills/) so an AI coding agent can drive it end to end, with the
per-stage gates and failure modes encoded. Ask for it in plain language and pass the run's parameters
as `key=value` lines. The agent asks for anything required that you leave out, rather than guessing:

```text
Use AnomalyGen skill with
name=phone_screen
mode=full
dataset_dir=datasets/phone_screen
num_sdg=100
max_iter=15000
validation_iter=1000
save_iter=1000
```

That runs all seven stages above. For a single stage, switch `mode` — e.g. `mode=generation_only`
with a `checkpoint=` and `recipe=` from an earlier run generates more images without retraining.
