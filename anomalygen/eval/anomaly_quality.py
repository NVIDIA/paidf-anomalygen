"""Defect-quality validation metrics: the raw geometry axes plus the ``aq_nn`` composite.

``aq_nn = completeness ① + nn_score ⑤`` — an equal-weight, bounded composite (each term in ~[0, 1],
no cross-sample standardisation) so it is directly comparable **across validation passes** and rises
as the model improves. (An earlier draft z-scored each term over the current pass; that recentres
every pass to ~0, so the cross-step ``Average`` the monitor / early-stop reads could not track
training — this formulation fixes that.) ``aq_nn`` is available and early-stop-selectable but is not
plotted by default and is secondary to ``nn_score``. Treat it as a dataset-native realism monitor,
not a human-alignment metric: on human 2AFC preferences it scored *below* its own ``completeness``
term (0.736 vs 0.763), because folding in ``nn_score`` (which anti-aligns with human preference,
AUROC ~ 0.48) pulls it down — so pick ``completeness`` if you want the better human-aligned early-stop.

Sub-metrics (each mirrors the offline implementation):

* ``completeness`` — diff-anchored A/B gated-SAM coverage of the WORST mask part. ``M_gen`` is
  ``A = SAM(whole-mask box)`` or ``B = SAM per diff-core cluster (union)``, both gated against the
  diff core; ``B`` wins when the change fragments into ≥2 clusters (else ``A``, else ``B``, else a
  low-threshold Otsu diff), which keeps a partially-generated *missing* defect low. The score is
  ``min_part |M_gen ∩ part| / |part|`` over the mask's connected parts. (①)
* ``precision`` — ``|M_gen ∩ mask| / |M_gen|``, the fraction of the segmented change kept inside the
  mask. (①)
* ``boundary_iou`` — Cheng CVPR21 boundary-band IoU of ``M_gen`` vs the mask. (①)
* ``nn_score`` — reused from :func:`compute_correspondence_kpi` (frozen DINOv2). (⑤)

``compute_anomaly_quality_kpi`` returns ``{anomaly_name: {"aq_nn", completeness, precision,
boundary_iou}, "Average": {...}}`` so :class:`ValidationKPI` can merge them into ``valid_kpi.csv``
alongside FID/NN; ``aq_nn`` is selectable as an early-stop / training-report metric by its
``METRIC_SPECS`` name.
