We'd love to receive your patches and contributions. Please keep your PRs as draft until such time that you would like us to review them.

## Setup

### Virtual environment

Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as the virtual environment manager.

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Build the venv:

```shell
# MAX_JOBS: parallel compile jobs (default 16)
# NVCC_THREADS: threads per nvcc invocation (default 1)
bash scripts/env_setup.sh [MAX_JOBS] [NVCC_THREADS]
```

Activate the environment and install the development tooling:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Install the pre-commit hooks so they run automatically on `git commit`:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

### Docker

The Docker `develop` image already bundles this dev tooling (`pytest`, `ruff`,
`pre-commit`) on top of the runtime, so you can develop in a container instead of the
venv. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md).

## Updating the cosmos-framework pin

This repo installs [cosmos-framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cosmos-framework) as a pip
package from a specific upstream commit, pinned in `requirements-nodeps.txt`. It is installed
with `--no-deps` because one of its pins contradicts ours: it declares
`transformers>=4.57.1,<5.0.0`, so a normal resolve would drag transformers back to 4.x. That
is the only conflict among its base dependencies — every other one it declares is already
satisfied by `requirements.txt`, which is where the subset this repo actually uses is pinned.
Its optional `train` extra, which we do not request, also pins `multi-storage-client==0.44.0`
against the 1.0.1 we ship; see the note in `requirements-nodeps.txt` for the API surface that
covers.

Bumping the pin means editing the `@<sha>` in `requirements-nodeps.txt`:

```shell
# 1. Resolve the target commit (or pick a specific <commit-sha>).
git ls-remote https://github.com/NVIDIA/cosmos-framework.git main

# 2. Edit the `@<sha>` suffix in requirements-nodeps.txt, then reinstall into the active venv.
uv pip install -r requirements-nodeps.txt --no-deps --reinstall-package cosmos-framework

# 3. Re-check that requirements.txt still covers the deps the new commit needs, then commit.
git add requirements-nodeps.txt
git commit -s -m "Bump cosmos-framework to <short-sha>"
```

## Regenerating the license file

`LICENSE-3rd-party.txt` is generated, not hand-edited. It reads license facts from the *installed*
distributions, so **generate it from the `develop` Docker image, not a local venv**

`develop` rather than `product` because `develop` is the image this project releases.

```shell
# build the develop image first (see docker/README.md), then:
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e USER="$(id -un)" -e HOME=/tmp \
    -v "$PWD:/workspace/paidf-anomalygen" -w /workspace/paidf-anomalygen \
    "$IMAGE" /opt/venv/bin/python scripts/generate_third_party_licenses.py
```

It covers every third-party package that ends up on disk, transitive dependencies included.
Regenerate it whenever dependencies change, review the diff, then commit the result.

A distribution whose wheel ships no license text is a hard error rather than a silent omission —
add it to `UPSTREAM_LICENSE_URLS` (citing the canonical upstream file) or, if no text exists
anywhere, to `NO_UPSTREAM_TEXT`.

## Test

### Run Linting and Formatting

```shell
pre-commit run -a
```

This runs the configured hooks over all files, including Python lint + autofix (`ruff check --fix`), Python formatting (`ruff format`), and Markdown formatting (`rumdl-fmt`). We recommend that you commit your changes first.

### Run Tests

```shell
pytest
```

Tests live under `tests/`, mirroring the `anomalygen/` package layout. The suite is CPU-only by
default: any test that needs a CUDA GPU is marked `@pytest.mark.gpu` and auto-skips when no GPU is
present (see `tests/conftest.py`).

### Test Coverage

`pytest-cov` reports coverage for the `anomalygen` package:

```shell
pytest --cov=anomalygen --cov-report=term-missing   # console, with uncovered lines
pytest --cov=anomalygen --cov-report=html           # browsable report in htmlcov/
```

Coverage settings live in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.coverage.*]`;
`tests/` and `anomalygen/scripts/` are excluded. The CI `test` job reports the total coverage.

### Run a Single Test

```shell
pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_name [--pdb]
```

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
