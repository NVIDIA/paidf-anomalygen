# 4 · Fine-tuning

This is the fourth page of the PAIDF AnomalyGen texture tutorial series:

1. [Overview & Setup](1-overview.md)
2. [Dataset Preparation](2-dataset-preparation.md)
3. [Auto Mask Placement](3-auto-mask-placement.md)
4. **Fine-tuning** ←
5. [Generation](5-generation.md)
6. [Evaluation, Refinement & Pseudo-labeling](6-evaluation-and-refinement.md)

It assumes you finished [`2-dataset-preparation.md`](2-dataset-preparation.md) — the prepared
`datasets/phone_screen/` — and [`3-auto-mask-placement.md`](3-auto-mask-placement.md), which built
the validation `datasets/validation_phone_screen/testcase.jsonl`.

Fine-tuning adapts the base Cosmos3 network into an anomaly-inpainting model for *your* defect types.
It trains only a small subset of parameters (per-defect-type LoRA adapters) on top of a frozen
base network, so runs are cheap and checkpoints are tiny. All commands run from the repo root.

## Prerequisites

Work from the environment shell you set up in [`1-overview.md`](1-overview.md) — either the activated
native venv (`source .venv/bin/activate`) or an interactive container shell (`$DOCKER -it bash`). All
commands below run from the repo root and are identical either way.

## The fine-tuning recipe

Open `ag_config/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml`. The top of the file identifies the run and the builder:

```yaml
task_type: texture_ft                    # selects the exp_config.py builder
experiment: anomalygen_texture_ft        # experiment node name (referenced on the CLI)
job_name: anomalygen_texture_ft          # this run's name (becomes the output folder name)
```

The **required dataset block** wires the fine-tuning recipe to the data you prepared in
[`2-dataset-preparation.md`](2-dataset-preparation.md) and the validation testcases built in
[`3-auto-mask-placement.md`](3-auto-mask-placement.md):

```yaml
# --- dataset (required) ---
dataset_name: phone_screen
anomaly_types: [[Phone, oil], [Phone, scratch], [Phone, stain]]
dataset_path: datasets/phone_screen
testcase_jsonl: datasets/validation_phone_screen/testcase.jsonl
```

- `dataset_name` — a label; also becomes the `<DATASET>` grouping folder in the output tree
  (see "Output directory structure" below).
- `anomaly_types` — the list of `[texture, defect]` pairs to train on. Each pair must have matching data
  on disk: for `[Phone, oil]` you need `datasets/phone_screen/Phone/anomaly_image/oil/` **and**
  `datasets/phone_screen/Phone/mask/oil/`. The `prepare_phone_screen_defect` script from
  [`2-dataset-preparation.md`](2-dataset-preparation.md) produced exactly
  this layout, so the three pairs above map onto the `oil` / `scratch` / `stain` subfolders.
- `dataset_path` — the prepared dataset root.
- `testcase_jsonl` — the JSONL of validation testcases used for the training-time validation passes.

### Key training knobs

All knobs are optional and live in the fine-tuning recipe. The values below are the **phone_screen
fine-tuning recipe's actual values**, which are also the builder defaults — deleting a key leaves
behaviour unchanged.

| Knob                    | Value   | Meaning                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `max_iter`              | `15000` | total training steps                       |
| `validation_iter`       | `1000`  | validate every N steps                     |
| `save_iter`             | `1000`  | checkpoint every N steps                   |
| `lr`                    | `1e-3`  | AdamW base learning rate                   |
| `batch_size`            | `4`     | samples per training step                  |
| `per_class_lora_rank`   | `8`     | per-defect-type adapter rank               |
| `per_class_lora_alpha`  | `8`     | per-defect-type adapter scale              |
| `model_size`            | `nano`  | backbone: `nano`, or `edge` (experimental) |

> **The augmentation probabilities are deliberately not in the sample recipe.**
> `background_dropout_prob`, `inst_aug_prob` and `ring_jitter_prob` all default to `0.5` and are the
> augmentation regime the model was validated under, not per-dataset dials — omit them and you get
> the validated behaviour. They are settable if you are deliberately running an ablation.

**`model_size` is the one to get right up front:** it picks the frozen Cosmos3 backbone (`nano` =
Qwen3-VL-8B, `edge` = Nemotron-3 Dense VL 2B) *and* the base checkpoint generation loads
(`checkpoints/Cosmos3-Nano` / `checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge`), so adapters trained at one size cannot be
generated with the other. Omitting it falls back to `nano`.

> **⚠ Use `nano` unless you have a specific reason not to.** `edge` is **experimental**: it is
> wired up end to end, but its generation quality has not been validated against `nano` on any
> dataset, and no result in this tutorial was produced with it. Treat `edge` output as unqualified
> until you have benchmarked it on your own data.

## Run the training

```shell
IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT="$PWD/results" \
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 anomalygen/scripts/texture/train.py \
    --config=cosmos_framework/configs/base/config.py \
    --recipe=ag_config/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml \
    -- experiment=anomalygen_texture_ft
```

- **`IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT`** sets where runs land (here `./results`).
- **`--nproc_per_node`** is the number of GPUs. Use `--nproc_per_node=8` for an 8-GPU node; the effective
  batch scales with it.
- **`--recipe`** points at your fine-tuning recipe (`ag_config/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml`) — the
  file you configured above. It supplies the dataset block and the training knobs; swap in
  `--recipe=ag_config/<your_recipe>.yaml` to train on your own data.
- **Quick smoke test:** append config overrides after the bare `--`, e.g.
  `trainer.max_iter=20 trainer.validation_iter=10 checkpoint.save_iter=10`, to confirm the pipeline
  runs end-to-end before committing to a full training. Use a fresh `IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT` — the
  trainer resumes from any checkpoint it finds — and set `save_iter` alongside the other two, or a
  20-iteration run writes no checkpoint at its default of `1000`.

### Output directory structure

Runs land under `IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT` at:

```text
results/anomalygen/<DATASET>/<JOB_NAME>/
```

where `<DATASET>` and `<JOB_NAME>` come from the recipe's `job.group` / `job.name` — i.e. its
`dataset_name` and `job_name`. For the phone_screen fine-tuning recipe that is
`results/anomalygen/phone_screen/<job_name>/`.

```

**Notes:**

- Because the trainer resumes from any checkpoint in this dir (via `latest_checkpoint.txt`), use a
  fresh `job_name` in the recipe (or a new `IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT`) when you want a clean run.
- **The two pointer files do different jobs.** `latest_checkpoint.txt` names the *last* iteration and
  is what resume reads — leave it alone. `best_checkpoint.txt` is written once at train end, names the
  best-scoring iteration by `early_stop_metric` (default `nn`, excluding iterations below 7500 on a
  run longer than that), and is what `--checkpoint <run_dir>` resolves through in
  [`5-generation.md`](5-generation.md). Runs routinely peak mid-training, so the latest is often not
  the best. If it is missing after a completed run, `stdout.log` says why — generation would
  otherwise fall back to the latest checkpoint without telling you.
- **`valid/<step>/reconstructed_image/` is the folder to watch.** These are the actual defect images the
  model synthesized at that `validation_iter` step — open them to see how generation quality improves as
  training progresses. The sibling subfolders (`original_image/`, `original_mask/`, the `cropped_*` /
  `annotated_image/` aids) are just the inputs and inspection views, and `valid_kpi.csv` records the
  per-type scores for that step — so you can eyeball progress without waiting for the end.
- **Anomaly-quality metrics.** Each validation also scores three geometry axes —
  `completeness` (gated-SAM coverage of the worst mask part), `precision` (change kept inside the
  mask), `boundary_iou` — plus the composite `aq_nn = completeness + nn_score`. `training_curves.png`
  plots the **six** per-sample metrics — `nn`, `mnn`, `fid`, `completeness`, `precision`,
  `boundary_iou`; the `aq_nn` composite is written to `valid_kpi.csv` and the training report (and is
  selectable via `early_stop_metric="aq_nn"`) but is **not** drawn on the curve. These need the SAM2
  model, so set `compute_anomaly_quality=False` in the recipe to skip that per-validation model load.
- **The `checkpoints/model/iter_*.pt` files are what you generate with.** They store only the trained
  per-defect-type LoRA parameters (not the frozen base network), so they are tiny.
  The `optim/` `scheduler/` `trainer/` folders exist only to resume training.
- **⚠ Small `/dev/shm`.** If the run aborts with a `/torch_*` shared-memory error, prepend
  `PYTHONPATH="$PWD/shmpatch"` to the command. It stops the dataloader from creating `/dev/shm/torch_*`
  files at all. As a further fallback you can also cut the worker counts, adding
  `dataloader_train.dataloader.num_workers=1 dataloader_val.num_workers=1` after the bare `--`.

## Fine-tuning on your own data

1. Copy the example fine-tuning recipe:

   ```shell
   cp ag_config/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml ag_config/exp_texture_ft_mydata.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the dataset block — `dataset_name`, `anomaly_types`, `dataset_path`, `testcase_jsonl` — to point
   at your prepared dataset (built the same way as in [`2-dataset-preparation.md`](2-dataset-preparation.md)).
   Make sure each `[texture, defect]` pair has a
   matching `{dataset_path}/{texture}/anomaly_image/{defect}/` and `{dataset_path}/{texture}/mask/{defect}/`.
3. Adjust a couple of common knobs if needed (`max_iter`, `batch_size`, `lr`).
4. Train with your fine-tuning recipe:

   ```shell
   IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT="$PWD/results" \
   torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 anomalygen/scripts/texture/train.py \
       --config=cosmos_framework/configs/base/config.py \
       --recipe=ag_config/exp_texture_ft_mydata.yaml \
       -- experiment=anomalygen_texture_ft
   ```
