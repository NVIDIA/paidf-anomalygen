# 6 · Evaluation, Refinement & Pseudo-labeling

This is the last page of the PAIDF AnomalyGen texture tutorial series:

1. [Overview & Setup](1-overview.md)
2. [Dataset Preparation](2-dataset-preparation.md)
3. [Auto Mask Placement](3-auto-mask-placement.md)
4. [Fine-tuning](4-fine-tuning.md)
5. [Generation](5-generation.md)
6. **Evaluation, Refinement & Pseudo-labeling** ←

It assumes you finished [`5-generation.md`](5-generation.md) and have a generation output tree at
`results/generation_phone_screen/`.

In this stage you **score** that batch, optionally **refine** each sample's generation params by
searching for a better `(guidance, crop_ratio)`, optionally **filter** the result into a clean
`keep/` set, and finally **pseudo-label** it into a ready-to-train COCO / classification dataset
(with optional captions). All commands run from the repo root.

## Prerequisites

Work from the environment shell you set up in [`1-overview.md`](1-overview.md) — either the activated
native venv (`source .venv/bin/activate`) or an interactive container shell (`$DOCKER -it bash`). All
commands below run from the repo root and are identical either way.

## Evaluation

Three steps act on the **generation output tree** from [`5-generation.md`](5-generation.md), in the
order this page runs them. All three score against your **real defect references** with the same
metrics the training-time validation uses — the NN/MNN (+ FID) correspondence KPI *and* the
anomaly-quality axes.

1. **Evaluation** (`evaluate.py`) — produces *scores*. Per-type and macro-average KPIs, so you can
   judge overall batch quality. Its KPI is also the baseline refinement searches against.
2. **[Quality refinement](#quality-refinement-optional)** (`quality_refine.py`, **optional**) — *improves the
   batch*, by re-generating each sample with better params and keeping the best render.
3. **[Filtering](#filtering-optional)** (`filter.py`, **optional**) — *ranks and splits*, dropping the
   lowest-scoring fraction per type into `keep/` and `drop/` trees.

Refinement comes before filtering because it makes weak samples better rather than discarding them —
filter last, on whatever the best version of the batch turned out to be.

### Shared inputs

`evaluate.py` and `filter.py` take the same two roots plus a type selector.

- **`--gen_root`** — the generation `--output_dir` from [`5-generation.md`](5-generation.md) (e.g.
  `results/generation_phone_screen/`). It must contain `reconstructed_image/` and
  `original_mask/`, named `{texture}+{defect}_{idx}.png`.
- **`--real_root`** — the real training dataset root (e.g.
  `datasets/phone_screen`), which must contain, per type:

  ```text
  datasets/phone_screen/
  └── {texture}/
      ├── anomaly_image/{defect}/<stem>.png
      └── mask/{defect}/<stem>_mask.png
  ```

- **Type selection** — `--recipe results/anomalygen/phone_screen/anomalygen_texture_ft/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml`
  (the copy saved in the run dir) derives the types to score from the fine-tuning recipe's
  `anomaly_types`. Alternatively pass `--anomaly_types Phone+oil Phone+scratch …` explicitly.

### Evaluate

Score the generated batch and write per-type + macro-average KPIs to a JSON.

```shell
python anomalygen/scripts/texture/evaluate.py \
    --gen_root results/generation_phone_screen \
    --real_root datasets/phone_screen \
    --recipe results/anomalygen/phone_screen/anomalygen_texture_ft/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml \
    --output_file results/generation_phone_screen/generation_phone_screen_kpi.json
```

**Output** — a JSON at `--output_file` with one block per anomaly type plus an
`Average` block (the macro-average across types):

```json
{
  "Phone+oil":     { "nn_score": <float>, "mnn_score": <float>, "fid": <float>,
                     "completeness": <float>, "precision": <float>, "boundary_iou": <float>,
                     "aq_nn": <float> },
  "Phone+scratch": { "…": "…" },
  "Phone+stain":   { "…": "…" },
  "Average":       { "…": "…" }
}
```

Each per-type block also carries a `per_sample` array — one entry per generated image with `path`,
`nn_score`, `mnn_score` and the per-sample axis scores (elided above); the `Average` block does not.

> **Judge scores against your own runs, not against a fixed target.** `nn_score` / `mnn_score` are
> relative measures whose absolute scale depends on the dataset *and* on the scoring config —
> which changed.

**Reading the KPI:**

- **`nn_score` / `mnn_score`** — nearest-neighbor and mutual-nearest-neighbor correspondence distances
  between each generated defect and its closest real references. These measure how close the synthetic
  anomalies land to the real ones.
- **`fid`** — an optional set-level Fréchet distance over the defect crops. It needs at least 2 crops
  per type.
- **`completeness` / `precision` / `boundary_iou`** — the anomaly-quality axes: how much of the mask
  the defect actually fills, how much of the change stayed inside it, and how well its boundary
  agrees. **`aq_nn`** is the composite `completeness + nn_score`, the same one training validation
  tracks and `early_stop_metric` can select on.

## Quality refinement (optional)

Refinement raises a batch's score by **re-generating its samples better**, not by discarding any:
`quality_refine.py` searches for a per-sample `(guidance, crop_ratio)` that scores higher than the one
generation used, keeping each mask placement fixed. Every sample ends up at its best-scoring render,
so the batch is the same size it started at.

### The loop

The `run` subcommand drives the whole thing: `(draw → generate → evaluate) × --num_search_run`, then
`select`, then a closing `evaluate` on the assembled bucket.

- **`draw`** writes one round's `testcase.jsonl` by re-drawing `(guidance, crop_ratio)` for **every**
  sample. Round 1 draws uniformly; rounds 2+ use **per-sample Bayesian optimization** — an independent
  Gaussian process over that one sample's own `(guidance, crop_ratio) -> score` history,
  Thompson-sampled. Draws are seeded — under `run`, each round is seeded with its own round number —
  so a round is reproducible.
- **`select`** picks each sample's best-scoring render across the original bucket and every round,
  into a `searched/` bucket.

```shell
python anomalygen/scripts/texture/quality_refine.py run \
    --base_testcase datasets/generation_phone_screen/testcase.jsonl \
    --original results/generation_phone_screen \
    --original_kpi results/generation_phone_screen/generation_phone_screen_kpi.json \
    --rounds_dir results/generation_phone_screen/rounds \
    --output results/generation_phone_screen/searched \
    --final_kpi results/generation_phone_screen/searched/kpi.json \
    --checkpoint results/anomalygen/phone_screen/anomalygen_texture_ft/checkpoints/model/iter_000015000.pt \
    --recipe results/anomalygen/phone_screen/anomalygen_texture_ft/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml \
    --real_root datasets/phone_screen \
    --num_search_run 3 --num_gpus 1
```

- **`--base_testcase`** — the AMP generation testcase file that produced `--original` (the mask
  placements the search holds fixed).
- **`--original` / `--original_kpi`** — the [generation](5-generation.md) output tree and its
  [evaluation](#evaluate) KPI JSON: round 0 of the search, and the baseline every round is measured
  against.
- **`--num_search_run`** (default `3`) — how many `draw → generate → evaluate` rounds to run. Each
  round costs one full generation pass over the batch, so this is the main cost dial.
- **`--score`** (default `nn`) — the per-sample metric the search optimizes and selects on: `nn`,
  `mnn`, `completeness`, `precision`, `boundary_iou`, or `aq_nn`. `aq_rank` is deliberately **not**
  offered here — it is a rank-relative composite whose value for one sample moves when its neighbours
  change, so it is not a fixed target a per-sample optimizer can climb.
- **`--guidance_range`** (default `1.5 10.0`) and **`--crop_ratio_range`** (default `1.5 8.0`) — the
  box the search draws from.
- **`--num_gpus`** — GPUs for each round's generation pass.
- **`--output_root`** (default `results`) — `IMAGINAIRE_OUTPUT_ROOT` for each round's `generate.py`.
  It is passed explicitly because the framework otherwise falls back to `/tmp/imaginaire4-output`
  without complaining.
- **`--dry_run`** prints each stage's command without running it.

> **⚠ Generate `--original` with the default `--base_seed`.** Rounds always run at `--base_seed 1`
> (`run` has no flag to change it). An original generated with a different seed carries different
> noise, so rounds win or lose on noise as well as on params.

`run` **gates each round** — one image per testcase row *and* its `kpi.json` — and exits non-zero
rather than assembling a stale `searched/` from an unfinished round. The scoring knobs it is given
are forwarded to every round's `evaluate`, so each round is scored exactly the way the batch it is
selected against was.

### Output

```text
results/generation_phone_screen/
├── rounds/
│   ├── round_1/    # that round's testcase.jsonl + generation tree + kpi.json
│   ├── round_2/
│   └── round_3/
└── searched/                              # the assembled best-of bucket
    ├── reconstructed_image/               # each sample's winning render

    ├── per_sample.csv                     # per-sample nn + mnn table
    └── kpi.json                           # --final_kpi: the refined batch's KPI
```

**`select` always runs**, so `searched/` always exists for pseudo-labeling — with
`--num_search_run 0` it simply clones `--original`.

**Reading the result:** the `Average.nn_score` delta between `searched/kpi.json` and the Step 5
`generation_phone_screen_kpi.json` is what refinement bought. Because selection is per sample, expect
the refined batch to beat *every* individual round. A `source` column that is all `original` means no
round beat the baseline for any sample — a valid outcome, not a failure; a delta near zero means the
search added nothing, so raise `--num_search_run` or widen `--guidance_range`.

## Filtering (optional)

Run it when you want a curated subset: it ranks each anomaly type by a per-sample score and splits the
batch into keep/drop trees, dropping the lowest-scoring `--drop_ratio` fraction **per type**.

Point `--gen_root` at the **refined** bucket if you ran refinement, so you curate the best version of
each sample rather than the first one; at `results/generation_phone_screen` if you skipped it.

```shell
python anomalygen/scripts/texture/filter.py \
    --gen_root results/generation_phone_screen/searched \
    --real_root datasets/phone_screen \
    --output_dir results/generation_phone_screen/filtered \
    --recipe results/anomalygen/phone_screen/anomalygen_texture_ft/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml \
    --drop_ratio 0.3            # keep the top 70% per type; --score defaults to nn
```

- **`--score`** (default `nn`) — the per-sample score to rank on:
  - `nn` / `mnn` — DINOv2 correspondence only. Fast, no extra models; `nn` is the primary KPI and
    needs no per-dataset tuning, hence the default.
  - `completeness` / `precision` / `boundary_iou` / `aq_nn` — one geometry axis on its own, or the
    `completeness + nn_score` composite.
  - `aq_rank` — `nn` and each geometry axis rank-normalised **within the anomaly type**, each axis
    signed `+`/`−` by whether it agrees with `nn`'s own strongest/weakest samples, then summed:
    `aq_rank = rank(nn) + Σ ±rank(axis)`. Best *mean* ranking across our internal datasets, but it
    signs itself from `nn`, so where `nn` is weak it can mis-sign an axis and score below plain `nn`
    — **opt-in**, not the default.
  - The geometry axes run SAM2, so any score using them needs `--real_root` and `original_image/`.
- **`--drop_ratio`** — fraction in `[0, 1]` to drop per type; `0.3` keeps the top 70%. Samples that
  could not be scored are dropped first.

For a fast correspondence-only pass (no SAM), rank on `nn`:

```shell
python anomalygen/scripts/texture/filter.py \
    --gen_root results/generation_phone_screen/searched \
    --real_root datasets/phone_screen \
    --output_dir results/generation_phone_screen/filtered \
    --recipe results/anomalygen/phone_screen/anomalygen_texture_ft/exp_texture_ft_phone_screen.yaml \
    --score nn --drop_ratio 0.3
```

**Output** — under `--output_dir`, a `keep/` and a `drop/` tree, each carrying
the reconstructed image, its mask, and the original image for every routed
sample (matched by basename):

```text
results/generation_phone_screen/filtered/
├── keep/
│   ├── reconstructed_image/   Phone+oil_00000.png …
│   ├── original_mask/         Phone+oil_00000.png …
│   ├── original_image/        Phone+oil_00000.png …
│   └── texture_ft_generation_result.csv   (when the input CSV exists)
├── drop/
│   ├── reconstructed_image/
│   ├── original_mask/
│   ├── original_image/
│   └── texture_ft_generation_result.csv   (when the input CSV exists)
└── texture_ft_generation_result_filtered.csv   (per-sample scores)
```

`texture_ft_generation_result_filtered.csv` lists every sample's `nn_score` and
`mnn_score`; when you filter on an axis or `aq_rank`, it also carries the
`completeness_score` / `precision_score` / `boundary_iou_score` columns and the composite
`aq_rank_score`. When the `texture_ft_generation_result.csv` from generation is present in
`--gen_root`, it is also split into `keep/` and `drop/` copies by output
filename.

## Putting it together

The three stages do different jobs with the same score, and only the first is mandatory:

- **Evaluation *measures*.** It answers "did the fine-tune produce defects that look like the real
  ones, on average and per type?" — and produces the KPI the other two are judged against.
- **Refinement *improves*.** It makes weak samples better by re-generating them with searched params,
  so nothing is discarded. Cost is `--num_search_run` extra generation passes, and the payoff is the
  `Average.nn_score` delta between `searched/kpi.json` and the Step 5 KPI. Skip it if a full extra
  pass over the batch is too expensive, or if that delta comes back near zero on your data.
- **Filtering *discards*.** It turns the same score into a curated set — the `keep/` tree holds the
  highest-scoring synthetic anomalies (image + mask + original), ready to drop into a downstream
  detector/segmentation training set as augmentation. Tune `--drop_ratio` to trade set size for
  average quality, and pick `--score` by how much scrutiny you want: `nn`/`mnn` for a fast
  correspondence-only pass, a single geometry axis to curate on one property, or `aq_rank` for the
  composite of both.

Run them in that order. Refining before filtering means a sample that would have been dropped gets a
chance to be fixed first; filtering first would throw away renders that refinement could have
rescued, and would spend the search's GPU time on a smaller batch for no quality gain.

Whichever you stop at is what you pseudo-label next — `searched/` after refinement,
`filtered/keep/` after filtering, or the raw generation tree if you skipped both.

## Pseudo-labeling

Generation gives you defect **images**; pseudo-labeling turns a generation batch into a **labeled
dataset** ready for downstream training. `pseudo_label.py` consumes the same generation output tree
and emits:

- a **COCO instance dataset** (`coco_annotations.json`) — each defect mask is split into per-instance
  masks and encoded as an RLE segmentation + bounding box, keyed by anomaly-type category;
- a **classification layout** (`classification/`) — the clean originals and every generated image
  sorted into per-class folders with a `classes.txt`;
- **visualizations** (`visualization/`) — each generated image with its instance masks, boxes, and
  class labels overlaid; and
- optional **natural-language captions** (`captions/`, `captions_with_meta/`) — one anomaly
  description per image from the Cosmos3-Nano reasoner.

### Inputs

- **`--gen_root`** — any tree containing `reconstructed_image/`, `original_image/`, `original_mask/`
  and the `texture_ft_generation_result.csv` manifest (used to look up each image's anomaly type).
  Three sensible choices:
  - **`results/generation_phone_screen/searched`** — the refined bucket. Use this if you ran
    [quality refinement](#quality-refinement-optional); it is every sample at its best-scoring render.
  - **`results/generation_phone_screen`** — the raw generation batch, if you skipped refinement.
  - **`results/generation_phone_screen/filtered/keep`** — a filtered `keep/` tree, to label only the
    samples that survived filtering.

### Run pseudo-labeling

```shell
python anomalygen/scripts/texture/pseudo_label.py \
    --gen_root results/generation_phone_screen/filtered/keep \
    --output_dir results/generation_phone_screen/filtered/pseudo_labels
    # add --no_caption to skip the VLM step (fast, no GPU model load)
```

With `--no_caption` you get the COCO dataset, classification layout and visualizations, but no
`captions/` or `captions_with_meta/`.

### Output folder structure

Everything lands under `--output_dir`:

```text
results/generation_phone_screen/filtered/pseudo_labels/
├── coco_annotations.json          # COCO instance annotations (per-instance mask → RLE + bbox)
├── images/                        # the generated defect images
├── masks/                         # the input defect masks
├── visualization/                 # mask + bbox + class-label overlays
├── classification/                # per-class image folders + classes.txt
│   ├── classes.txt                #   "original" + one line per anomaly type
│   ├── original/                  #   the clean input images
│   ├── Phone+oil/                 #   generated images, one folder per anomaly type
│   ├── Phone+scratch/
│   └── Phone+stain/
├── captions/                      # one .txt caption per image (omitted with --no_caption)
└── captions_with_meta/            # same caption prefixed with a timestamp + meta block
```

- **`coco_annotations.json`** — standard COCO `{images, annotations, categories}`. Each mask is split
  into up to `--max_instances` per-instance masks (connected components, matching generation's
  `--max_instances`), and every instance becomes one annotation with an RLE `segmentation`, `bbox`,
  `area`, and `category_id`. Category ids are assigned to the sorted anomaly-type names.
- **`classification/`** — the clean originals under `original/` and each generated image under its
  `{texture}+{defect}/` folder, with `classes.txt` listing `original` followed by the anomaly types —
  a ready-to-use image-classification split.
- **`visualization/`** — the generated image with each instance mask tinted and its box + class label
  drawn on, for eyeballing the labels.
- **`captions/` and `captions_with_meta/`** — the Cosmos3-Nano reasoner is shown the (mask, clean,
  generated) triple and asked to describe the anomaly; `captions_with_meta` prepends a creation
  timestamp and the per-image meta (image/anomaly type, boxes).

### Useful flags

- **`--no_caption`** — skip captioning (no VLM load).
- **`--max_instances`** — max per-instance masks to split each mask into (default 5, matching
  `generate.py`).
- **`--csv_path`** — override the manifest CSV (defaults to `{gen_root}/texture_ft_generation_result.csv`).
- **`--captioner_temperature` / `--captioner_max_tokens` / `--captioner_seed` / `--captioner_prompt_path`**
  — captioner generation knobs; the temperature defaults to `0`, which decodes greedily. Pass
  `>0` to sample at that temperature instead.
