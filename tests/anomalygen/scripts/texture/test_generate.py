"""Unit tests for generate.py's distributed work-splitting / result-merging helpers.

Importing generate.py runs the framework's ``init_script`` at module load, so these tests are kept
in their own module. They exercise the pure single-rank paths with real inputs (no GPU, no
distributed init, no mocks) — in particular the guardrail block-record -> merge -> ``guardrail_blocked.csv``
path, which is otherwise only exercised end-to-end.
